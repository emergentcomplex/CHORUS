# 5. THE DEFINITIVE FIX FOR BLOAT: Install CPU-only torch.
RUN uv pip install --system torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# 6. Install all other dependencies. uv will see torch is installed and skip it.
RUN uv pip install --system .

# 7. Copy the entire application and test source.
COPY . .

# 8. Install the application in editable mode.
RUN uv pip install --system -e .

# --- Stage 2: The "Production" Stage ---
