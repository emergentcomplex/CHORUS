> ‚ú® **The loudest secrets are kept in silence. We built an engine that listens.**
>
> We believe that silence is not an absence of data, but a signal in itself. A budget line vanishes into shadow. A job posting for a cleared physicist appears like a flare in the night. A cluster of obscure academic papers creates a new hum in the noise.
>
> CHORUS is an observatory for these echoes. It is a fully autonomous, self-healing, and evolving intelligence platform designed to fuse disparate, open-source data verticals into a single, coherent revelation. It does not give you an answer; it delivers a **verdict**.

### üèõÔ∏è The Architecture in Four Views

To comprehend CHORUS is to view it through four distinct lenses, each revealing a different layer of its soul.

<br>

#### üß† **View I: The Judgment Process**

_This is the **why** of the system: the logical flow of how an AI council debates and synthesizes a query into a final verdict._

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'dark', 'themeVariables': { 'primaryColor': '#14b8a6', 'primaryTextColor': '#ffffff', 'lineColor': '#a1a1aa'}}}%%
graph TD
    subgraph "Tier 0: The Query"
        A[User Query]
    end

    subgraph "Tier 1: The Analyst Wing (Parallel Analysis)"
        direction LR
        style AnalystTier fill:#1e293b,stroke:#334155

        subgraph AnalystTier[ ]

            P2["<i class='fa fa-user-secret'></i> Analyst Dove"]
            P3["<i class='fa fa-user-secret'></i> Analyst Skeptic"]
            P4["<i class='fa fa-user-secret'></i> Analyst Futurist"]
        end

        R1[Preliminary Report 1]
        R2[Preliminary Report 2]
        R3[Preliminary Report 3]
        R4[Preliminary Report 4]

        P1 --> R1
        P2 --> R2
        P3 --> R3
        P4 --> R4
    end

    subgraph "Tier 2: The Director's Synthesis"

    subgraph "Tier 3: The Final Verdict"
        style Judge fill:#be123c,stroke:#f43f5e
        Judge("<i class='fa fa-gavel'></i> Judge Prime") --> Verdict([Final Verdict])
    end

    A --> AnalystTier

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **View II: The Dataflow Engine**

_This is the **how** of the system: the physical infrastructure and data's journey through our containerized, event-driven services._

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'dark', 'themeVariables': { 'primaryColor': '#3b82f6', 'primaryTextColor': '#ffffff', 'lineColor': '#a1a1aa'}}}%%
graph TD
    subgraph "Write Path (User Interaction)"
        A["<i class='fa fa-desktop'></i> Web UI"] -- "1 INSERT task" --> D{"<i class='fa fa-database'></i> PostgreSQL (System of Record)"};
    end

    end

    style D fill:#047857,stroke:#34d399,color:#fff
```

#### üõ†Ô∏è **View III: The Development Praxis**

_This is **how we trust** the system: the `Makefile`-driven workflow that separates rapid iteration from hermetic verification._

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'dark', 'themeVariables': { 'primaryColor': '#d946ef', 'primaryTextColor': '#ffffff', 'lineColor': '#a1a1aa'}}}%%
graph LR
    subgraph "Developer's Machine"
        Dev(Developer) -- "Edits Code" --> Editor[<i class='fa fa-code'></i> IDE / Code Editor]
    end

    subgraph "Fast Loop (95% of workflow)"
        style FastLoop fill:#1e293b,stroke:#334155
        subgraph FastLoop [ ]
            Dev -- "1 `make run-dev`" --> C[Running Containers]
            Editor -.-> C
            Dev -- "2 `make test-fast`" --> T1(Fast Tests)
            T1 -- "Asserts against" --> C
        end
    end

    subgraph "Verification & Release"
        style VerificationLoop fill:#450a0a,stroke:#be123c
        subgraph VerificationLoop [ ]
            Editor -- "git commit -m 'feat: ...'" --> PR(Pull Request)
            PR -- "Triggers" --> CI(CI/CD Gatekeeper)
            CI -- "Runs `make test`" --> T2(Hermetic Test Suite)
            T2 -- "On Success" --> Merge(Merge to Main)
        end
    end
```

#### üåÄ **View IV: The Team Topology**

_This is **how we organize** for flow: as a single, stream-aligned team building and consuming our own internal platform._

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'dark', 'themeVariables': { 'primaryColor': '#ca8a04', 'primaryTextColor': '#ffffff', 'lineColor': '#a1a1aa'}}}%%
graph TD
    subgraph "CHORUS Organization"
        Team[
            <b>Stream-Aligned Team: CHORUS Core</b><br>
            <i>End-to-end ownership of the<br>CHORUS Judgment Engine.</i>
        ]

        Platform[
            <b>Internal Platform</b><br>
            <i>The `Makefile`, Docker configs, and CI/CD pipeline<br>that enable self-service testing and deployment.</i>
        ]

        Team -- "Consumes (X-as-a-Service)" --> Platform
        Team -- "Builds & Maintains" --> Platform
    end
```

### üöÄ Your First Session

Ready to join the chorus? Here‚Äôs how to get the engine running.

**Prerequisites:** Git, Docker & Docker Compose.

**Step 1: Clone & Configure** üß¨

```bash
# Clone the repository and enter the directory
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd CHORUS

# Create your personal environment file for development
cp .env.dev .env

# Add your API keys to the new .env file
nano .env
```

**Step 2: Build & Launch** üõ∞Ô∏è

```bash
# This single command builds the base image and starts all services.
# The first run will be slow; subsequent runs will be fast.
make run-dev
```

**Step 3: Observe** üî≠

- **CHORUS C2 UI:** `http://localhost:5002`
- **Redpanda Console:** `http://localhost:8081`

**Step 4: Power Down** üîå

```bash
# Stop and remove all running containers and volumes for the dev environment.
make stop-dev
```

### üìú Our Guiding Philosophy

Development on CHORUS is not arbitrary. It is a disciplined practice guided by a set of foundational documents that define our mission, our architecture, and our commitment to verification.

- **The Constitution:** The supreme law governing the system's design and mission.
- **The Development Protocol:** The supreme law governing how we build, test, and release software.

Before contributing, we ask that you read these documents in the `/docs` directory to understand the principles that make CHORUS possible.

---

### ü§ù Answering the Call

Contributions are welcome, but they are judged against the high standards set forth in our canonical documents. If you are ready to build a system of judgment, we are ready to hear your voice.
