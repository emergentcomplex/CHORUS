## Overview

**CHORUS** is not a search engine; it is a judgment engine. It is a fully autonomous, self-healing, and evolving intelligence platform designed to fuse disparate, open-source data verticals into high-fidelity, actionable insights.

This repository contains the complete source code, documentation, and development tools for the CHORUS project.

## Getting Started

The definitive guide for setting up, configuring, and running the CHORUS system is the **Mission Charter**. It contains the full Quickstart Guide and an overview of the system's architecture.
