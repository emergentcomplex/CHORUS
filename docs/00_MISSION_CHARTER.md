# ðŸ”± CHORUS: The Mission Charter

> âœ¨ _The loudest secrets are kept in silence. We built an engine that listens._ âœ¨

## Overview

**CHORUS** is not a search engine; it is a judgment engine. It is a fully autonomous, self-healing, and evolving intelligence platform designed to fuse disparate, open-source data verticals into high-fidelity, actionable insights.

## System Architecture: The Dataflow Engine

CHORUS is a data-intensive application built on the principles of the "Unbundled Database." It uses a collection of specialized, containerized services that communicate via an immutable event log (Redpanda, a Kafka-compatible stream). This architecture ensures scalability, resilience, and evolvability.

## Quickstart Guide

This guide provides the definitive steps to set up and run the entire CHORUS system locally using `make` and Docker.

### Prerequisites

- **Git:** For cloning the repository.
- **Docker & Docker Compose:** For running the entire containerized environment.
- **An IDE:** For editing code on your host machine.

### 1. Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository and navigate into it
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd CHORUS

# Create your personal environment file from the template
cp .env.example .env

# Open .env with your editor and add your GOOGLE_API_KEY
# nano .env
```

### 2. Build and Run the System

This single command builds the Docker images (a one-time slow operation) and starts all services in development mode.

```bash

# This command will stop, build, and start the entire stack.
make rebuild
```

Subsequent starts can use the faster `make run` command.

### 3. Access the System

- **CHORUS C2 UI:** [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001)
- **Redpanda Console (Kafka UI):** [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### 4. Shut Down the System

```bash
# Stop and remove all running containers and volumes.
make stop
```
