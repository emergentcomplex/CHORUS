# ðŸ”± Contributing to CHORUS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the CHORUS project. To maintain the quality, consistency, and architectural integrity of the system, we adhere to a strict, axiom-driven development process.

## The Guiding Principles

Before making any changes, you must familiarize yourself with the three foundational documents of this project, all located in this `/docs` directory:

1.  **The Mission Charter (`./00_MISSION_CHARTER.md`):** This document outlines the high-level mission, features, and setup instructions for the project. Ensure any proposed change aligns with this mission.

2.  **The Constitution (`./01_CONSTITUTION.md`):** This is the canonical source of truth for the system's design. It contains the **Axioms of CHORUS Development**. All contributions will be judged against the principles in this document.

3.  **The System SLOs (`./03_SYSTEM_SLOS.md`):** This document defines the explicit performance and reliability targets for the system. All code must be written with the goal of meeting or exceeding these objectives.

## The Development Praxis

Our development process is designed to fulfill **Axiom 49: Deliberate Velocity**. We have gone well, so that we may now go fast. The `Makefile` provides two distinct, purpose-built workflows: a **Fast Loop** for rapid, iterative development, and a **Verification Workflow** for ensuring correctness.

### I. The Fast Loop (Your 95% Workflow)

This is the workflow for all day-to-day coding. It is designed for an instant feedback loop.

**To start your work session:**

```bash
# Starts all services in the background with your local code mounted.
make run
```

**To test your code as you work:**

# Run the full suite of tests against the ALREADY RUNNING system.

# This is your primary, fast-feedback command.

```bash
make test-fast
```

**To observe the system:**

```bash
# Tails the aggregated logs from all running services in real-time.
make logs
```

**To end your work session:**

```bash
# Stops and removes all running containers and volumes.
make stop
```

### II. The Slow Loop (The Rebuild Path)

You only need this workflow when you change the foundational environment itself (e.g., editing `pyproject.toml` or the `Dockerfile`).

```bash
# Stops the stack, rebuilds the base Docker image, and restarts in dev mode.
make rebuild
```

### III. The Verification Workflow (For CI/CD)

This is the single, atomic command that a continuous integration server must use. It is slow, hermetic, and guarantees correctness from a clean slate.

```bash
# Builds, starts, sets up, tests, and tears down the entire system.
make test
```

### IV. The Bug Fix Protocol (The Mandate of Correction)

**All bug fixes MUST adhere to Axiom 56: The Mandate of Mandated Regression Testing, as defined in the Constitution.**

This is a TDD-style approach to ensuring the system's reliability continuously improves. The workflow is non-negotiable:

1.  **Find a Bug:** Identify an issue during manual use or via an existing test failure.
2.  **Write a Failing Test:** Before fixing any application code, create a new automated test (unit, integration, or E2E) that specifically targets the bug and fails in the same way.
3.  **Fix the Bug:** Implement the necessary code changes in the application.
4.  **Verify the Fix:** Run your new test and confirm that it now passes.
5.  **Verify the System:** Run the entire test suite (`make test`) to ensure your fix has not introduced any regressions.
6.  **Commit:** Commit both the fix and the new test together.
