# ðŸ”± The Architectural Vision of CHORUS

> âœ¨ _"The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system."_ - Robert C. Martin

This document provides a series of architectural diagrams based on the **C4 Model**. Each diagram offers a different level of abstraction, allowing us to understand the system from the highest-level context down to the interaction of its core components. The diagrams are themed to reflect the pathos and purpose of the CHORUS mission.

### **Diagram 1: The Observatory (C4 Level 1: System Context)**

This diagram places the CHORUS engine in its world. It shows how it interacts with users and the vast, noisy universe of open-source data. It answers the question: What is CHORUS and who uses it?

        C((<b>CHORUS Observatory</b><br><br><i>An autonomous engine that listens to the echoes of silence in open-source data to render judgment on hidden activities.</i>))
    end

    U[<b>Human Analyst</b><br><i>(The Inquirer)</i>]

    U -- Submits Queries & Receives Judgments --> C
    C -- Listens for Signals --> "The Public Record"

### **Diagram 2: The Dataflow Engine (C4 Level 2: Containers)**

This diagram zooms into the CHORUS Observatory itself, showing the major, independently deployable services (containers) that comprise the system. It illustrates the "Unbundled Database" architecture and the flow of data through our asynchronous, event-driven ecosystem. It answers the question: What are the major building blocks of the CHORUS engine?

```mermaid

    end

### **Diagram 3: The Adversarial Council (C4 Level 3: Components)**

This diagram is a logical view, not a physical one. It zooms into the "Analysis Daemons" container to show the components that execute our core mission logic. It visualizes the flow of judgment through the three tiers of our adversarial process. It answers the question: How does CHORUS _think_?

```mermaid

    subgraph "Tier 1: The Analysts (Divergence)"

        A3[<b>Analyst Skeptic</b><br><i>Oversight-focused</i>]
        A4[<b>Analyst Futurist</b><br><i>Capability-focused</i>]
    end

    subgraph "Tier 2: The Directors (Synthesis)"
        style "Tier 2: The Directors (Synthesis)" fill:#0c4a6e,stroke:#0ea5e9
        DIR[<b>Director Alpha</b><br><i>Synthesizes competing views into a single, coherent briefing.</i>]
    end

    subgraph "Tier 3: The Judge (Verdict)"
        style "Tier 3: The Judge (Verdict)" fill:#7f1d1d,stroke:#ef4444

    end
