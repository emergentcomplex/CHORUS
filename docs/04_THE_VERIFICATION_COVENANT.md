## The Mandate of Trust

> âœ¨ A judgment cannot be trusted if its creation cannot be verified. âœ¨
>
> The CHORUS engine is designed to produce high-fidelity, actionable insights. This fidelity is not an emergent property; it is an engineered outcome. The foundation of this outcome is a rigorous, automated, and multi-layered verification strategy.
>
> This document, The Verification Covenant, codifies the philosophy that guarantees the correctness, resilience, and performance of the CHORUS engine. It is the supreme law governing *why* we prove our work.
>
> The specific, inviolable principles of verification are codified as **Axioms 60 through 76** in the [ðŸ”± The Constitution](./00_THE_CONSTITUTION.md). Adherence to this covenant and its corresponding axioms is non-negotiable, as it is the source of our trust in the system's final judgment.
