# Idea 04: Implement the "Chain of Justification"

**1. Concept:**
Upgrade the data structure of our analytical outputs to create an explicit, auditable "Chain of Justification." This means that every report generated by a lower-level persona (an Analyst) must structurally and explicitly inform the higher-level persona (the Director) about the *methods* and *sources* used to reach its conclusions.

**2. Problem Solved:**
- **Methodological Blind Spots:** The current architecture has an implicit information flow. A Director receives an Analyst's final brief but has no machine-readable way of knowing which specific RAG queries, harvester keywords, or tools the Analyst used. This prevents the Director from performing a true meta-analysis of the team's research strategy.
- **Lack of Deeper Reasoning:** Without this methodological context, the Director can only synthesize the *conclusions* of its analysts. It cannot perform higher-level reasoning, such as:
    - "My Hawk and Futurist analysts both independently decided to search for 'photonic integrated circuits' and found corroborating evidence. This convergence increases my confidence."
    - "My Dove analyst found no public news, while my Skeptic found numerous small grants. This discrepancy in their findings, based on their different collection strategies, is itself a key insight."

**3. Proposed Solution:**
This will be implemented by enriching the data passed between the Analyst and Director tiers.

- **A. Enrich the `final_brief` Schema:**
  - The JSON object that a `persona_worker` saves as its `final_brief` in the `tasks` table will be amended.
  - A new, mandatory top-level key, `"methods"`, will be added.
  - This key will contain a structured dictionary detailing every significant action the Analyst took:
    ```json
    "methods": {
      "rag_queries": ["Quantum Computing", "post-quantum cryptography"],
      "collection_plan": [
        {"harvester": "usaspending_search", "keywords": "DARPA Quantum Information Science"},
        {"harvester": "usajobs_live_search", "keywords": "Quantum Physicist TS/SCI"},
        {"harvester": "newsapi_search", "keywords": "Quantum breakthrough China"}
      ]
    }
    ```

- **B. Upgrade the `persona_worker`:**
  - The `persona_worker` will be responsible for gathering this methodological data throughout its execution and adding it to its final output before saving to the database.

- **C. Upgrade the `director_worker` Synthesis Prompt:**
  - The `director_worker` will be upgraded to fetch this new, richer data structure for all four of its subordinate Analysts.
  - Its final synthesis prompt will be significantly enhanced. It will be explicitly instructed to not just synthesize the analysts' conclusions, but to **evaluate their methods**. The prompt will include instructions to:
    - "Review the `methods` section of each brief."
    - "Identify areas of methodological convergence and divergence."
    - "Comment on the confidence of your final judgment based on the quality and alignment of your team's collection strategy."

**4. Next Steps:**
- This is a **core architectural feature for the Phase 2 `director_worker`**. It is what elevates the Director from a simple synthesizer to a true manager and meta-analyst.
- It requires a formal Amendment Proposal to the Constitution to:
  - Update the "Triumvirate Architecture" section to describe this explicit flow of methodological data.
- The implementation will involve modifying the `persona_worker` to produce this richer output and designing the new, more sophisticated synthesis prompt for the `director_worker`.
