# Idea 05: Implement the Recursive Inquiry Feedback Loop

**1. Concept:**
Transform the CHORUS engine from a linear, request-response system into a true, self-perpetuating learning organism. This will be achieved by making the "Intelligence Gaps" identified in a final report actionable, automatically feeding them back into the harvesting engine to guide future data collection.

**2. Problem Solved:**
- **Static Intelligence:** The current system answers a query and then stops. Its knowledge is only as good as the last question asked. It does not have a mechanism for proactive, self-guided learning or for monitoring a developing situation over time.
- **Wasted Insight:** The "Intelligence Gaps" section of a report is currently just informational for the human user. This is a wasted opportunity. These gaps are a perfect, AI-generated list of the system's own known unknowns, and they should be used to make the system smarter.

**3. Proposed Solution:**
This will be implemented by creating a new feedback loop between the final output of the analysis engine and the input of the harvesting engine.

- **A. The "Gap Parser" Component:**
  - A new function or small utility will be created. After a final Judge's Report is generated, this component will be triggered.
  - It will take the plain-text "Intelligence Gaps" section of the report as its input.
  - It will make a simple call to the **Utility Model** with a prompt like:
    > "You are a data tasking analyst. Convert the following intelligence gaps into a series of concise, machine-readable keyword sets suitable for a search engine. Return a JSON object with a single key: 'new_keywords', which is a list of strings."

- **B. The "Persistent Monitoring" Task:**
  - The `trident_launcher` or a new, dedicated "meta-worker" will take the list of new keywords generated by the Gap Parser.
  - For each new keyword, it will create a new, **persistent, low-priority** task in the `harvesting_tasks` table.
  - These tasks will be configured with a long `scrape_interval_hours` (e.g., 168 hours for a weekly check).
  - This effectively tells the `trident_sentinel`: "The last analysis revealed we don't know enough about 'photonic integrated circuit manufacturing in Taiwan.' From now on, once a week, run a search for this term across all our data sources and update the Data Lake."

- **C. The Learning Loop:**
  - Over time, the `harvesting_tasks` table will become an evolving, AI-curated list of the system's own strategic interests.
  - When a user asks a new question, the RAG search and the harvesters will now have access to a much richer, pre-collected set of data on topics the system itself previously identified as important. This creates a virtuous cycle of continuous improvement.

**4. Next Steps:**
- This is a **foundational feature for the Phase 3 "Full Symphony"**. It is the final step that makes the system truly autonomous and "evolving."
- It requires a formal Amendment Proposal to the Constitution to:
  - Formally codify the **"Axiom of Recursive Inquiry."**
  - Update the "Architectural Diagram" to show the feedback loop from the Final Report back to the Harvesting DB Queue.
- The implementation will involve creating the "Gap Parser" utility and upgrading the `trident_launcher` or creating a new meta-worker to manage the persistent task creation.
