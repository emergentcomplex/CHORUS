# Idea 09: Implement the "Living World Model" (Dynamic Persona Evolution)

**1. Concept:**
Evolve the AI personas from static, hard-coded definitions into dynamic, learning agents. This will be achieved by creating a new, persistent "Meta-Cognition Daemon" that periodically reviews the system's performance and proposes targeted, evidence-based amendments to the personas' core axioms and parameters, enabling the entire analytical council to learn and adapt over time.

**2. Problem Solved:**
- **Static Intelligence:** A system with fixed personas will always have the same inherent biases and blind spots. It cannot adapt to a changing world or learn from its own mistakes.
- **Brittle Personas:** A persona's worldview, while powerful, might be flawed. The "Hawk" might be too aggressive, or the "Futurist" too optimistic. Without a mechanism for self-correction, these flaws will persist indefinitely, degrading the quality of the final analysis.

**3. Proposed Solution:**
This will be implemented as a new, standalone daemon that operates on a slow, periodic cycle (e.g., weekly) and interacts with our established Amendment Process.

- **A. The "Meta-Cognition Daemon":**
  - A new script, `meta_cognition_daemon.py`, will be created.
  - Once a week, it will query the database for all `analysis_sessions` completed in the last seven days.

- **B. The Dual-Trigger Analysis (per your directive):**
  - The daemon will analyze the collected sessions for two distinct types of failure or surprise, using both quantitative and qualitative triggers:
    1.  **Quantitative Performance Analysis:** The daemon will analyze the quantitative scores from our `ab_test_judger` (if available for a session). It will look for patterns. For example: "In sessions related to economic forecasting, reports from Directorate Charlie, which includes the 'Fiscal Watchdog' analyst, consistently receive low scores on the 'Strategic Insight' dimension."
    2.  **Qualitative Surprise Analysis:** The daemon will perform a "longitudinal gap analysis." It will take the "Intelligence Gaps" from a report generated last month and compare them to the raw data harvested on the same topic this month. It will then make a call to the **Utility Model** with a prompt like: "Does the new raw data contain significant, high-impact information that was not anticipated at all by the old intelligence gaps? If so, this represents a 'surprise'."

- **C. The Amendment Proposal Generation:**
  - When the daemon identifies a significant pattern of failure or surprise, it will trigger its core function. It will make a high-level call to the **Synthesis Model**.
  - The prompt will be a sophisticated, meta-cognitive one:
    > "You are an AI cognitive psychologist. An analysis of the CHORUS system's performance has revealed the following flaw: [Insert the finding, e.g., 'The Analyst Hawk persona consistently overestimates the timeline for technological deployment.'].
    >
    > **[Persona Definition]:**
    > `(The full definition of the flawed persona, including its axioms)`
    >
    > **[Example of a High-Performing Analysis on the Same Topic]:**
    > `(The text of a successful report from a different persona)`
    >
    > **Your Task:**
    > Propose a single, small, and precise amendment to the flawed persona's axioms or parameters that would help it mitigate this specific failure in the future. Your output must be in the format of a formal Amendment Proposal."

- **D. Human-in-the-Loop Governance:**
  - The daemon will take the LLM-generated Amendment Proposal and automatically create a new, pre-filled **GitHub Issue** using the `propose_amendment.sh` tool we designed.
  - This alerts the human architect (you) that the system has identified a flaw in its own reasoning and has a suggestion for how to fix it. You have the final say on whether to accept, reject, or modify the proposed change.

**4. Next Steps:**
- This is a highly advanced, state-of-the-art capability that represents the ultimate evolution of the CHORUS engine. It is best slated for **Phase 4**, after the full Triumvirate Council is operational and has generated enough data to make this kind of meta-analysis meaningful.
- It requires a formal Amendment Proposal to the Constitution to:
  - Codify the "Axiom of Meta-Cognitive Evolution."
  - Update the "Codebase Architecture" to include the new `meta_cognition_daemon.py`.
- The implementation will involve creating the new daemon and designing the sophisticated meta-analysis and amendment-generation prompts.
