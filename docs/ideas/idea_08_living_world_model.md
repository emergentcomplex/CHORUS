# Idea 08: Implement the "Living World Model" (Dynamic Persona Evolution)

**1. Concept:**
Evolve the AI personas from static, hard-coded definitions into dynamic, learning agents. This will be achieved by creating a new, persistent "Meta-Cognition Daemon" that periodically reviews the system's performance and proposes targeted, evidence-based amendments to the personas' core axioms and parameters.

**2. Problem Solved:**

- **Static Intelligence:** A system with fixed personas will always have the same inherent biases and blind spots. It cannot adapt to a changing world or learn from its own mistakes.
- **Brittle Personas:** A persona's worldview, while powerful, might be flawed. Without a mechanism for self-correction, these flaws will persist indefinitely.

**3. Proposed Solution:**
This will be implemented as a new, standalone `meta_cognition_daemon.py` that operates on a slow, periodic cycle.

- **A. The Dual-Trigger Analysis:**

  - The daemon will analyze completed sessions for two types of failure or surprise.
  - **Quantitative Performance Analysis:** This involves analyzing the numerical scores from the `ab_test_judger`.
  - **Qualitative Surprise Analysis:** This involves a "longitudinal gap analysis," which will use a call to the **`utility`** model tier to detect if new data contains significant information that was not anticipated by old intelligence gaps (`llm_client.generate_text(..., model_type='utility')`).

- **B. The Amendment Proposal Generation:**

  - When the daemon identifies a significant pattern of failure or surprise, it will trigger its core function.
  - It will make a high-level, meta-cognitive call to propose a change to a persona's axioms. This is an extremely abstract and difficult reasoning task.
  - Therefore, this call will exclusively use the **`apex`** model tier to ensure the highest quality proposal (`llm_client.generate_text(..., model_type='apex', is_json=True)`).

- **C. Human-in-the-Loop Governance:**
  - The daemon will take the LLM-generated Amendment Proposal and automatically create a new, pre-filled GitHub Issue for human review and approval.

**4. Next Steps:**

- This is a highly advanced, state-of-the-art capability best slated for **Phase 4**.
- It requires a formal Amendment Proposal to the Constitution to codify the "Axiom of Meta-Cognitive Evolution."
- The implementation will involve creating the new daemon and designing the sophisticated meta-analysis and amendment-generation prompts.
