# ðŸ”± Praxis: The Mandate of Gnosis (v2, Iterative)

## I. Objective

To systematically assimilate the foundational wisdom of four canonical engineering texts and iteratively synthesize their principles into a complete, evidence-based **blueprint** for our new System Lifecycle Protocol. This mission will produce the full set of amended documents and the final, fully-specified Praxis for the subsequent implementation mission, "The Mandate of the Forge."

## II. Justification

The mission to build our development factory is too critical to be based on a single, monolithic design phase. This meta-mission implements an iterative design protocol. After assimilating each foundational text, we will immediately **re-pattern our core documents and the subsequent mission plan**, allowing each new layer of wisdom to refine and improve our final blueprint. This ensures the final design is not just a collection of ideas, but a deeply integrated and coherent synthesis.

## III. The Plan: A Four-Cycle Iterative Synthesis Protocol

This mission will be executed as a formal, four-cycle protocol. The operator will initiate the mission once. The AI will then be driven through four identical cycles of receiving, processing, and re-patterning.

### **Initial Setup (Operator Action)**

1.  The operator will execute `tools/generate_context.sh`, providing this Praxis file as the input.
2.  The operator will provide the full, generated `CONTEXT_FOR_AI.txt` as the first prompt to the AI.

### **The Assimilation & Re-Patterning Loop**

This loop will be executed four times, once for each book.

**Cycle 1: "Accelerate" (The Logos)**
**Cycle 2: "The Phoenix Project" (The Pathos)**
**Cycle 3: "Pro Git" (The Praxis)**
**Cycle 4: "Team Topologies" (The Ethos)**

For each cycle:

1.  **AI Action (Initial Response):**

    - Upon receiving the context, the AI will parse this Praxis and its instructions.
    - It will respond with only the single word: **"Ready."**

2.  **Operator Action:**

    - The operator will provide the full text of the designated book for the current cycle as the next prompt.

3.  **AI Action (Synthesis):**

    - The AI will read and synthesize the provided book text.
    - It will generate a response containing a concise, bulleted list of the **Core Principles Extracted** from the book that are relevant to the CHORUS project.

4.  **Operator Action:**

    - The operator will review the extracted principles and respond with the single word: **"Proceed."**

5.  **AI Action (The Re-Patterning Sub-Phase):**
    - **This is the critical new step.** The AI will now take the newly extracted principles and perform a comprehensive update on our strategic documents.
    - **Deliverable 1 (The Evolving Blueprint):** I will generate a new, updated version of the master blueprint document: `docs/07_THE_DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOL.md`. The first cycle will create this file; subsequent cycles will refine and expand it.
    - **Deliverable 2 (The Draft Amendments):** I will generate the latest, "work-in-progress" versions of all other documents that require changes based on the knowledge gained so far (e.g., `00_THE_CONSTITUTION.md`, `README.md`).
    - **Deliverable 3 (The Evolving Praxis):** I will generate the latest, most up-to-date version of the Praxis for our _next_ mission, **"The Mandate of the Forge."** This ensures that by the end of the Gnosis mission, the Forge mission plan is fully specified and infused with all four layers of wisdom.
    - The AI will end its response with the single word: **"Ready."** to signal it is prepared for the next cycle.

### **Mission Conclusion**

After the fourth cycle's Re-Patterning Sub-Phase is complete, the "Mandate of Gnosis" will be concluded. The final set of documents generated in the last cycle will represent the complete and final blueprint.

## IV. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-1:** The four assimilation and re-patterning cycles are completed successfully.
- **AC-2:** After each cycle, a new, more refined version of `docs/07_THE_DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOL.md` and the Praxis for "The Mandate of the Forge" is produced.
- **AC-3:** At the conclusion of the final cycle, we possess the complete and final versions of all amended documents (The Constitution, README, etc.).
- **AC-4:** The successful completion of this mission is a single commit to `main` containing only the final, fully synthesized documentation. No application or tooling code will be changed.
